  Query Parameters

  For list endpoints:
  - page: Page number for pagination
  - per_page: Items per page
  - sort: Field to sort by
  - order: Sort direction (asc/desc)

  For search endpoint:

  - fields: Which fields to search (name, code, etc.)

  For report endpoint:
  - format: Output format (json, yaml)

  Implementation Approach

  1. Create a new Api::V1 namespace in the Rails application
  2. Implement API controllers for each resource type
  3. Use existing models and report helpers for data retrieval
  4. Add JSON serializers for consistent response formatting
  5. Implement pagination, sorting, and filtering
  6. Add proper error handling and status codes
  7. Include documentation using OpenAPI/Swagger

  This API design provides access to all the core functionality while maintaining the same data structure and relationships that exist in the current application.
